# Rust

### Useful commands

* To override default toolchain for a particular project: `rustup override set nightly`. The directory is stored in `~/.rustup/settings.toml` \(in `overrides` section\) separately from the project itself.
* To print all package dependencies as a nice tree in the command line, we can use `cargo tree` - more details [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/cargo/commands/cargo-tree.html) \(works starting from Rust 1.44\)

### Closures

* A [good post](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rustifications/2018/08/18/rust-closures-are-hard.html) by Steven Donovan about closures in Rust. It makes the connection between closures and structs, explains why `move |...|` is sometimes needed and why we have to add lifetimes annotations like `where F: Fn(i32) -> i32 + 'a>`
* All the nitty-gritty details are available in the Rust language reference \(sections ["Closure expressions"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/expressions/closure-expr.html) and ["Closure types"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/types/closure.html)\).

### Common/standard traits, conversion

* ["Rust's Built-in Traits, the When, How & Why"](https://llogiq.github.io/2015/07/30/traits.html) by Lloqiq \(2015\)
* ["The Common Rust Traits"](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rustifications/2018/09/08/common-rust-traits.html) by Steve Donovan \(2018\)
* ["Use conversion traits"](https://deterministic.space/elegant-apis-in-rust.html#use-conversion-traits) part from "Designing elegant APIs in Rust" by Pascal Hertleif \(a very insightful post!\) \(2016\)
* ["Conversion" ](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/conversion.html)section in "Rust by Example"
* ["Convenient and idiomatic conversions in Rust"](https://ricardomartins.cc/2016/08/03/convenient_and_idiomatic_conversions_in_rust) by Ricardo Martins \(2016\)
* Rust reference: ["Special types and traits"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/special-types-and-traits.html)

### Lifetimes, NLL

* [RFC-2094](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2094-nll.md) about Non-Lexical Lifetimes: why and when they are needed, design
* ["Lifetimes"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/lifetimes.html) and the following sections in Rustonomicon
* ["Understanding Rust Lifetimes"](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/understanding-rust-lifetimes-e813bcd405fa) by Maksym Zavershynskyi
* [Common Rust lifetimes misconceptions](https://github.com/pretzelhammer/rust-blog/blob/master/posts/common-rust-lifetime-misconceptions.md)

### Error handling

* [Error handling survey - 13 Nov 2019](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/error-handling-survey/) - many error handling packages reviewed and compared
* [Structuring and handling errors in 2020](https://nick.groenen.me/posts/rust-error-handling/)
* [Error handling in Rust](https://blog.burntsushi.net/rust-error-handling/) by Andrew Gallant \(burntsushi\)
* [The state of error handling in Rust 2018 edition](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/the-state-of-error-handling-in-the-2018-edition/23263)
* [Notice: failure is deprecated](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/gcbcew/notice_failure_is_deprecated/) on Reddit

### Profiling on Mac

* [Profiling with](https://gist.github.com/loderunner/36724cc9ee8db66db305#profiling-with-sample) `sample`
* ["Rust profiling with DTrace and FlameGraph on MacOs"](https://carol-nichols.com/2017/04/20/rust-profiling-with-dtrace-on-osx/) by Carol Nichols, a simple easy to follow reference
* [Inferno](https://docs.rs/inferno/0.9.5/inferno/) by Jon Gjengset for producing flame-graphs from process samples. Rust port of [flame-graph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph) tools. Its README.md on GitHub has lots of useful information. Btw, there is a 5 hours [video stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTpK-bNZiA4) of how this tool was actually coded live! 

### Misc

* ["Rust Tidbits: What is a Lang Item?"](https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/01/11/rust-tidbits-what-is-a-lang-item/) - an interesting explanation about  traits and other items known to the Rust compiler and marked with `#[lang]` annotation. I really enjoyed this article, but for some reason it was quite hard to google to find it again \(perhaps because I googled "traits" and "lang" is not a very googleable term\).
